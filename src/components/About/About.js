      <h4>I'm AJ, a Front-End Developer!</h4>
      
      I design and develop innovative solutions using readable code. It wasn't always like this though. I started my professional career in the military and quickly transitioned over to mortgage banking and management.
      A little under two years ago I found my fascination for technology and started building technical skills starting with a simple "pwd" command in a terminal. 
       I'm looking to join a team who also has a passion for technology, design and just computers in general. I want to leverage my corporate background, knowledge, and ambition curating new ideas and be a team-player to a dynamic organization.
